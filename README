VirtualTrader Beta
===================

VirtualTrader Beta is the latest modification of VirtualTrader.
The website will use much cleaner coding, and PHP Classes,
simplifying in-site operations.

This new system uses the PHP Auth Class I developed, and uses
custom cookie based sessions, that last 1 month before expiry.

Whilst in development, pages are accessible via the GET Variable,
"page"

Example : 127.0.0.1/?page=login

This will be changed when in Production via Htaccess to provide
cleaner URLs

Example : 127.0.0.1/login

Each page requires an $title and $content to be displayed correctly.
Error / Success messages from the class are displayed if they exist
on any page.
