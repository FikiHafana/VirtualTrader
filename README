VirtualTrader
=============

VirtualTrader is a virtual stock market trading game, where players
buy and sell actual shares at their real-time prices, with virtual
money. The aim of the game is to make as much as possible trading
these shares.

All users start off with 200.00 $ 

------------------------------------------------------------------

The system is based around two central PHP classes : auth.class.php
and virtualtrader.class.php, the Auth class handles user authentication
and session protection, whilst the VirtualTrader class handles the buying
and selling of shares, listing, obtaining live prices etc...

The real time prices are obtained Via Google Finance, for them to be more
or less real time, a cron job is required to run every 5 minutes to update
the database.

Whilst in development, pages are accessible via the GET Variable,
"page"

Example : 127.0.0.1/?page=login

This will be changed when in Production via Htaccess to provide
cleaner URLs

Example : 127.0.0.1/login

VirtualTrader features a basic template system : the template is the
same on all pages, each page is differed by it's $title and $content
variables.

The included "virtualtrader.sql" is the default Database layout, which
also includes 40 well known technology companies' stocks.

Error / Success messages from the class are displayed if they exist
on any page, this is built into the template system : No need to add
any error displaying in the page's $content variable
